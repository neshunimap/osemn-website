        <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Demand Forecasting and Inventory Optimization in Walmart Using the OSEMN Framework</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Obtain:</strong> Walmart collects data from multiple sources such as point-of-sale (POS) data from stores, online purchase transactions, customer loyalty program data, weather data and holiday calendars, inventory and supplier data.</li>
            <li><strong>Scrub:</strong> The data is cleaned and prepared by removing duplicates transactions, fixing missing or incorrect prices and quantities, and standardizing product names and categories.</li>
            <li><strong>Explore:</strong> Walmart analyzes the data to find patterns by identifying peak sales periods (holidays, weekends), understanding regional buying trends, and visualizing sales trends using charts and dashboards.</li>
            <li><strong>Model:</strong> Walmart builds predictive models to forecast product demand for each store, predict stock-outs and overstock situations and improve supply chain efficiency using machine learning models.</li>
            <li><strong>Interpret:</strong> The results are used to make business decisions such as improve product availability for customers and increase revenue and customer satisfaction.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Why this is a real-life use case:</strong> Walmart is known for using big data analytics and predictive modeling to manage one of the world’s largest retail supply chains, making OSEMN a perfect framework to describe their data-driven decision-making.</p>
